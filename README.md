## Reflection

This was a 6 week long project not finished yet, built during WeCode Bootcamp for Front-End development. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 6.3.0, Redux, Typescript, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS.
